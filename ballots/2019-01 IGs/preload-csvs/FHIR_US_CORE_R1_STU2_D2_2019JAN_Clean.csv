Typically, DocumentReference resources are used with document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS. However, document references may also may be created “on-the-fly” in response to a Document Query request. In other words there MAY NOT be pre-existing index of references to a patient’s documents at the FHIR endpoint. This results in an empty bundle being returned when searching using a normal FHIR Query. Therefore, the $docref operation has been defined to both create and fetch patient DocumentReference Resources.

",,"It is very confusing the intention of the $docref operation. It seems to be a duplicate of the more simple RESTful query. The given text seems to indicate that it would be impossible to ""create and fetch"" during a RESTful query. This is not specifically true except in an architecture that has not-otherwise-specified ways. If there is a special reason for a client to choose to use $docref vs using query parameters, then this must be explained. If there is a special reason why a server would want $docref to be supported, then this must be explained. Without these explaination then $docref should be removed from the specification as leaving it into the US-Core leads to interoperability problems as it provides two similar functionality for no defined benefit or difference.
I suspect the intent of $docref is good. It is just not well enough explained. I understand that as an operation the $docref would be more easy to intercept/orchistrate to enable dynamic (on-demand, or delayed-assembly) type documentReference entries). If this is the sole motiviation, then this needs to be more clearly said. If this done, then there must be some further mitigation of why a client would use $docref vs RESTful query; especially as this profile is orchistrated such as in clinical-note.

The discussion on the clinical-notes-guidance.html page is intended to describe the need for DiagnosticReport vs DocumentReference. There are several formats of notes 'PDF', 'XHTML', 'CDA' and using a resource that indexes clinical note content helps implementers (clients) find notes without querying lots of resources. Consider a lab report that has both narrative and discrete content vs a scanned report. Should that be a 'Clinical Note' or a DiagnosticReport?",,,,,,,,,,,Thomson Kuhn ,ACP ,,tkuhn@acponline.org ,,,,,,
