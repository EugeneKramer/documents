It covers both human and veterinary medicine ",,"Supporting both Human and Veterinary, are there potential conflicts inherent to supporting both that will need to be identified within resources, e.g. species?  From a practical implementation and certification process E.g.
1. We ran into a case where a medication code used in vetrinary medicine was used in human system certification testing, which was inappropriate and not supported.  Ultimately the Certification test data was changed. 
2. PDMP (Prescription drug monitoring program) data is not standard across states. In one state species was a  required data element related to a human patient denied a narcotic medication becasue it was also written for their pet. Species is also pointless data in a human based system.
