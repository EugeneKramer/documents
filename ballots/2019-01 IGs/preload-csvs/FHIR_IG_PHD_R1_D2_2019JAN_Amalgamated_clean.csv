Under 1.2.5.10, Generating the PHD Reported Time Stamp Identifier, absolute time is recorded.  Coincident Time Stamp is also collected, may not allow for deriving local time when device out of range, transmission asynchronous. 
Is local device timestamp or time zone also collected? How to ensure we know time relative to patient’s perspective?
Nothing tobacco specific or unique to tobacco use that would raise questions. Any data collected pertaining to tobacco use would be under Questionnaire CDA or captured under Observation.code.coding.code element which is flexible.","Is local device timestamp or time zone also collected?
